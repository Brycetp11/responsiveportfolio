# responsiveportfolio

This project is my first attempt at creating a responsive portfolio using bootstrap. 

This includes an about me section with a photo and blurb about my life. 

This also includes a portfolio section which uses the grid system in bootstrap. 

This will eventually house my projects completed during this class. 

The last page in this site is the contact page, which will eventually be used to contact me.

Also in the navbar of this page is included a link to my linkedin page.
